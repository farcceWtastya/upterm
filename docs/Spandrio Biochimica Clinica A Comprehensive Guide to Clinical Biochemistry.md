- Part I: General Biochemistry, which introduces the basic concepts of biochemistry, such as biomolecules, enzymes, metabolism, and genetic information.
- Part II: Analytical Biochemistry, which describes the methods and techniques used to measure and analyze biochemical parameters in biological samples, such as blood, urine, and tissues.
- Part III: Pathological Biochemistry, which explains the biochemical alterations that occur in various pathological conditions, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, liver diseases, renal diseases, and cancer.
- Part IV: Special Biochemistry, which covers some specific topics of clinical interest, such as hormones, vitamins, drugs, toxins, and trace elements.

The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous tables, figures, and diagrams to illustrate the concepts and data. The book also includes case studies, exercises, and self-assessment questions to help the reader apply the knowledge and test their understanding. The book is suitable for students and professionals in the fields of medicine, pharmacy, biotechnology, and biomedical sciences who want to learn more about the role of biochemistry in clinical practice.

In this article, we will explore some of the topics that are covered in Spandrio Biochimica Clinica, and how they relate to clinical practice. Some of the topics are:
 
## Molecular Biology and Genetics
 
Molecular biology and genetics are the study of the structure and function of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and how they regulate cellular processes and inheritance. Molecular biology and genetics are essential for understanding the molecular basis of diseases, such as genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases. Molecular biology and genetics also provide tools for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases, such as molecular testing, gene therapy, and pharmacogenomics[^1^].
 
## Therapeutic Drug Monitoring and Toxicology
 
Therapeutic drug monitoring and toxicology are the study of the effects of drugs and toxins on the body, and how to measure and optimize their therapeutic and safety profiles. Therapeutic drug monitoring and toxicology are important for ensuring the efficacy and safety of drugs, especially those with narrow therapeutic windows, such as antiepileptics, immunosuppressants, and antibiotics. Therapeutic drug monitoring and toxicology also help to detect and manage drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, drug abuse, overdose, poisoning, and environmental exposure[^1^].
 
## Laboratory Immunology
 
Laboratory immunology is the study of the immune system and its role in health and disease. Laboratory immunology involves the measurement and analysis of immune cells, molecules, and functions, such as leukocytes, antibodies, cytokines, complement, hypersensitivity, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, transplantation, and infection. Laboratory immunology helps to diagnose and monitor immune-mediated diseases, such as allergies, autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, transplant rejection, and infectious diseases[^1^].
 
## Laboratory Medicine
 
Laboratory medicine is the application of laboratory tests to clinical practice. Laboratory medicine involves the selection, performance, interpretation, and reporting of laboratory tests for various clinical purposes. Laboratory medicine helps to support clinical decision making in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, therapy monitoring, screening, prevention, and research[^1^].
